    /*
     The difference between this impl. and the previous is that,
     rather than creating and retaining a matrix of size s.length()+1
     by t.length()+1, we maintain two single-dimensional arrays of
     length s.length()+1.  The first, d, is the 'current working'
     distance array that maintains the newest distance cost counts as
     we iterate through the characters of String s.  Each time we
     increment the index of String t we are comparing, d is copied to
     p, the second int[].  Doing so allows us to retain the previous
     cost counts as required by the algorithm (taking the minimum of
     the cost count to the left, up one, and diagonally up and to the
     left of the current cost count being calculated).  (Note that the
     arrays aren't really copied anymore, just switched...this is
     clearly much better than cloning an array or doing a
     System.arraycopy() each time through the outer loop.)

     Effectively, the difference between the two implementations is
     this one does not cause an out of memory condition when
     calculating the LD over two very large strings.
